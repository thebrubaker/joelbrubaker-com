## Introduction

I'm a software engineer who loves working with passionate teams to build best-in-class products. My experience extends across a wide range of industries including healthcare, finance, online retail, fitness tech and digital marketing.

I value companies that are driven by a mission to do good, committed to equitable hiring practices, and take the time to invest in new talent, as well as current employees.

## Background

Over the last decade, I've worked on a variety of application architectures including stateless APIs, server-rendered applications, static sites, analytics dashboards, single page applications, microservices, 3rd party integrations and open source developer tools.

My curiosity resonates across the tech stack, including in-depth experience with UX/UI, frontend frameworks, backend web servers, cloud architecture, server administration, asychronous job processing, ETL pipelines, and data analytics.

I have specialized experience working with Laravel, Vue.js, Google Cloud Platform and MySQL, but my interests extend into Go, Node.js, gRPC, and Kubernetes.
