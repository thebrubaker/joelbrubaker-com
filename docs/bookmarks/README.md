## Embracing the Differences : Inside the Netflix API Redesign

> As I discussed in my recent blog post on ProgrammableWeb.com, Netflix has found substantial limitations in the traditional one-size-fits-all (OSFA) REST API approach. As a result, we have moved to a new, fully customizable API. The basis for our decision is that Netflix’s streaming service is available on more than 800 different device types, almost all of which receive their content from our private APIs. In our experience, we have realized that supporting these myriad device types with an OSFA API, while successful, is not optimal for the API team, the UI teams or Netflix streaming customers.

## Pattern: API Gateway / Backends for Frontends

> Let’s imagine you are building an online store that uses the Microservice architecture pattern and that you are implementing the product details page. You need to develop multiple versions of the product details user interface: HTML5/JavaScript-based UI for desktop and mobile browsers - HTML is generated by a server-side web application; Native Android and iPhone clients - these clients interact with the server via REST APIs. In addition, the online store must expose product details via a REST API for use by 3rd party applications.

## Kubernetes 101: Pods, Nodes, Containers, and Clusters

> Kubernetes is quickly becoming the new standard for deploying and managing software in the cloud. With all the power Kubernetes provides, however, comes a steep learning curve. As a newcomer, trying to parse the official documentation can be overwhelming. There are many different pieces that make up the system, and it can be hard to tell which ones are relevant for your use case. This blog post will provide a simplified view of Kubernetes, but it will attempt to give a high-level overview of the most important components and how they fit together.

## You are managing state? Think twice.

> Recently I started questioning the state management in React applications. I’ve made some really interesting conclusions and in this article I’ll show you that what we call a state management may not be exactly about managing state.

## Wikipedia: Slowly changing dimension

> Dimensions in data management and data warehousing contain relatively static data about such entities as geographical locations, customers, or products. Data captured by Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) change slowly but unpredictably, rather than according to a regular schedule.

## Single-Page Apps

> Single-page apps (or browser-based apps) run entirely in the browser after loading the Javascript and HTML source code from a web page. Since the entire source is available to the browser, they cannot maintain the confidentiality of a client secret, so the secret is not used for these apps. The flow is exactly the same as the authorization code flow, but at the last step, the authorization code is exchanged for an access token without using the client secret.

[https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/single-page-apps/)

## The Client ID and Secret

> The client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it’s public, it’s best that it isn’t guessable by third parties, so many implementations use something like a 32-character hex string. It must also be unique across all clients that the authorization server handles. If the client ID is guessable, it makes it slightly easier to craft phishing attacks against arbitrary applications.

## How JavaScript works: WebRTC and the mechanics of peer to peer networking

> This is post # 18 of the series dedicated to exploring JavaScript and its building components. In the process of identifying and describing the core elements, we also share some rules of thumb we use when building SessionStack, a JavaScript application that needs to be robust and highly-performant to help users see and reproduce their web app defects real-time.

## Domain Logic and SQL

> Over the last couple of decades we've seen a growing gap between database-oriented software developers and in-memory application software developers. This leads to many disputes about how to use database features such as SQL and stored procedures. In this article I look at the question of whether to place business logic in SQL queries or in-memory code, considering primarily performance and maintainability based on an example of a simple, but rich SQL query.

## Take charge of your data: using Cloud DLP to de-identify and obfuscate sensitive information

> In our previous “Taking charge of your data” post, we talked about how to gain visibility into your data using the Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API. But discovering sensitive data is just the start. In this post we’ll tackle how to protect that data by incorporating data obfuscation and minimization techniques automatically into your workflows—leaving less potential for human error.

## Basic search theory

> Searching for words in documents faster than scanning over them requires preprocessing the documents in advance. This preprocessing step is generally known as indexing, and the structures that we create are called inverted indexes. In the search world, inverted indexes are well known and are the underlying structure for almost every search engine that we’ve used on the internet. In a lot of ways, we can think of this process as producing something similar to the index at the end of this book. We create inverted indexes in Redis primarily because Redis has native structures that are ideally suited for inverted indexes: the SET and ZSET.1

## The Magic of strace

> Early in my career, a co-worker and I were flown from Memphis to Orlando to try to help end a multi-day outage of our company’s corporate Lotus Domino server. The team in Orlando had been fire-fighting for days and had gotten nowhere. I’m not sure why they thought my co-worker and I could help. We didn’t know anything at all about Lotus Domino. But it ran on UNIX and we were pretty good with UNIX. I guess they were desperate.

## Daylight saving time and time zone best practices

> Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards. For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear. How should the time of the order be persisted?

## How is JavaScript used within the Spotify desktop application?

> I would bet that the Spotify desktop client is among the top 25 most intricate uses of JavaScript in the world. The Spotify desktop client UI is completely built with JavaScript, resting on top of the same C++ core that the iOS and Android clients uses. The C++ core is responsible for things like playback, providing offline editing of playlists and local files, but rendering and interacting with the UI is handled by JavaScript. The communication between the C++ parts and JavaScript is done through a simple messaging interface simply called bridge. The UI itself is HTML/CSS, which is generated by Handlebars and LESS.

## Implementing micro frontends to overcome technical debt

> Any company that is constantly innovating, upgrading and pushing out new products is likely to rack up technical debt. This debt consists of the time and resources it takes to modify or enhance systems. While some level of technical debt is healthy, too much can throttle innovation. And the longer you take to address it, the bigger the bill will be when you finally decide to pay it off.

## The Twelve-Factor App

> This document synthesizes all of our experience and observations on a wide variety of software-as-a-service apps in the wild. It is a triangulation on ideal practices for app development, paying particular attention to the dynamics of the organic growth of an app over time, the dynamics of collaboration between developers working on the app’s codebase, and avoiding the cost of software erosion.

## Why Google defined a new discipline to help humans make decisions

> Cassie Kozyrkov is Google’s first-ever chief decision officer. She has already trained 17,000 Googlers to make better decisions by augmenting data science with psychology, neuroscience, economics, and managerial science. Now Google wants to share this new discipline–which it calls Decision Intelligence Engineering–with the world.

## The Reporting API

> The Reporting API defines a new HTTP header, Report-To, that gives web developers a way to specify server endpoints for the browser to send warnings and errors to. Browser-generated warnings like CSP violations, Feature Policy violations, deprecations, browser interventions, and network errors are some of the things that can be collected using the Reporting API.

## Real Work vs. Imaginary Work

> Since we launched Hill Charts in Basecamp we’ve been fielding many interesting questions. One common question is: how do we catch more problems in the uphill phase so they don’t surprise us later?

## Twitter Thread: Former Tesla Employee

> A former Tesla employee, who worked on their IT infrastructure, is posting in a subforum of a subforum, a little-known place for funy computer forgotten by time. His NDA has expired. He has such sights to show us. Join me and I will be your silent guide into a world of horror.

## Dealing With Compiled Files in Git

> If you have file A, and every time you change A, file B gets rebuilt, and you have to commit file B, these steps will help you. These examples are written with Sass in mind. You should never commit built or compiled files to Git. Always try to fix that first. These steps are only a last resort. Maybe you're working in a hostile or junior ecosystem where removing the built files is impossible.

## Life of Cloud Spanner Reads & Writes

> Spanner is a strongly-consistent, distributed, scalable database built by Google engineers to support some of Google's most critical applications. It takes core ideas from the database and distributed systems communities and expands on them in new ways. Cloud Spanner exposes this internal Spanner service as a publicly available service on Google Cloud Platform.
